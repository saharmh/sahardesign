I love to learn new skills! Whether itâ€™s for my professional life or personal, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve. How about you?

Iâ€™m assuming yes, because youâ€™ve navigated to this post.

As designers, our field is always changing. Yet instead of taking night classes at a local college or University, we can rely on the Internet to help update our skill sets.

Thankfully thereâ€™s a plethora of online courses available and at any price point. You can easily become a Photoshop pro or earn a certificate in social media online. The options are endless.

I personally learn better by watching videos, and if you are like me, youâ€™ll find the resources below helpful. Theyâ€™ve definitely helped me throughout the years.

Here are my top 6 favourite online learning tools and courses you can use to help further your expertise. Best part, you can learn at your pace and track your progress. Enjoy!


### 01. LYNDA.COM

Lynda.com founded by Lynda Weinman is one of the most popular websites for online training and offers a wide variety of high-quality courses.

Iâ€™ve been a Lynda.com subscriber for over 10 years and I check out a topic every few weeks. I joined their website when they only had a handful of subjects. Now you can find tutorials on most subjects through their site. They also have an amazing selection of influencer interviews that Iâ€™m a big fan of.

Lynda.com was recently acquired by LinkedIn. If you have a LinkedIn account you can now connect the two and have your completed courses show up on your LinkedIn profile as lynda.com certificates. This can be a plus if you are looking for a job ðŸ˜‰

They have over 1000 videos created by expert teachers on web design, coding and business.

Treehouse breaks courses down into easy-to-digest chunks with quizzes and mini-challenges which are fun to do.

Skillshare is a learning community for creators. Anyone can take an online class, watch video lessons, create projects, and even teach a class themselves.

One of my favourite courses on Skillshare is Lettering for Designers: One Drop Cap Letterform at a Time by Jessica Hische a San Francisco based illustrator.

Udemy has a massive and varied catalog of self-paced online courses, many of which are free. It enables professionals to share or sell their expertise through courses.

Udemy courses are divided into sections and lectures. Lectures can be video micro-lectures, but they can also include audio, text, and presentation slides.

My favourite course on Udemy is Seth Godinâ€™s Freelancer course.

### 05.THE CREATIVE CLASS

The Creative Class by Paul Jarvis is an online business course for freelancers to help get more clients, better pay for designers, developers, writers and more.

It took me a long time to find a good course like The Creative Class. Learning the business side of things through this course will prove to be invaluable in your career.

I love Paulâ€™s style of teaching, since he gives examples from his personal experiences. Itâ€™s nice to learn from an entrepreneur who has over 20 years of experience as a freelancer and who also understands the design side of things.

Once you sign up for his course youâ€™ll also get access to a Slack channel where you can connect with hundreds of other freelancers to chat, brainstorm, talk pricing and get feedback.
